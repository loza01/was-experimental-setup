        <p style="margin-left: 12%; text-align: left;">Welcome back! We will now begin the post-trial questionnaire. Please, keep in mind the following points:</p>
        <ul class="list-group lead">
          <li>The questions can be done on any device.</li>
          <li>The questionnaire might last you between 5 to 10 minutes, depending on your speed.</li>
          <li>There is no time limit to answer all the questions.</li>
          <li>All questions are required. To pass from one page to another page it's necessary to answer all the questions.</li>
          <li>Due to the structure of the research, we have disabled the "Back" button during the questionnaire. Please do not try going back to a previous page.</li>
          <li>You won't be allowed to change responses once the questionnaire is submitted.</li>
          <li>Please try to complete the questions in one sitting, since still, you can not go back to the previous page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you!</p>
