            <ul>
              <li id="l-4"><strong>Role One:</strong> You were interacting with the augmented content as the device holder.</li>
              <li id="l-5"><strong>Role Two:</strong> You were interacting with the augmented content as a non-device holder with your partner who was holding the device.</li>
